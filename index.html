        <p>   I am referred to as James T Salamonsen but my operating name is Jt. I grew up in Seattle for almost the entierty of my life.  I also do not believe
            that I will leave Seattle either, I have not found a place that I like better. For most of my early education I did home school but in high school I went to SHoreline Christian.
            I did 4 years of college doing Web Application and Design but found that my hobby became my job, which lead me to
            not want to do computers anymore.  I then heavily got immeressed in the tree cutting industry for about 6 years whic made me a lot of money.
            Due to having a bunch of money at a young age, I also got heavily involved in auto mechinc work.  I purchased my third vehcile which is a cobalt blue
            Ford Ranger.  But from cutting all those trees and working on vehicles eventually gave me a herniated disc in my lower back.  Granted it's not as bad as some injuries, the location and
            size of the herniation leaves me with numb/tingly legs and hands.  That is how I got the name O'l Numb Hands.  During that same time of my back being
            injured, my lung collapsed.  The two of them together left me without a job for quite a while.  Now that I have the ability to sit or do stuff with out
            being in too much pain, I got back into computer science.
